# NLP_Keyword_Suggestion
A simple NLP-powered web application that provides intelligent word suggestions as you type, trained on a custom corpus

---

# How It Works
- book.txt is read and tokenized using regular expressions
- A frequency dictionary of all words is built
- When user types a prefix like "pro", the app:
- Finds all words starting with that prefix
- Sorts them by probability (frequency / total words)
- Returns top 5 suggestions
